## 🏗 Project Structure

So the purpose is to take the advantage of the type system of TypeScript and to use the power of Nx workspace to create multiple applications with the powerful framework Angular!

So we have 3 applications:

1. Popup (`apps/popup`) - used for the upper popup
2. Options (`apps/options`) - used for the options page
3. DevTools Panel (`apps/devtools-panel`) - used for the devtools panel

In every Chrome extension we have background script that communicate with the content scripts, which can be found in `apps/scripts/background/src/main.ts`.

We are also can inject content script which can be found in `apps/scripts/content/src/main.ts`.

All the applications have already the Chrome types so can just use `chrome` and the editor will recognize it.

## 🕹 Commands

Start with development configuration

```shell
npm run start:dev
```

Start with production configuration.

```shell
npm run start:prod
```

Build with development configuration.

```shell
npm run build:dev
```

Build with production configuration.

```shell
npm run build:prod
```

## 📦 Release

I recommend making the release automatic with GitHub actions or other ci service.

- Bump the version number in `manifest.json`
- Create a git tag containing the version you are releasing using `git tag -a <version>`
- Run `npm run build:prod`
- Create zip file from the extension directory
- Upload the zip to the Chrome developer dashboard
